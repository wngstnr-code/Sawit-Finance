## The Problem

Indonesia produces ~60% of the world's palm oil — a **$30B+/year** export market. Yet that revenue is completely off-chain and inaccessible to global investors:

- **No fractional access.** You can't buy a $100 stake in a palm oil estate's revenue.
- **Opaque pricing.** CPO prices clear in daily KPBN tender auctions most investors never see.
- **Trust gap.** Real-world-asset (RWA) tokenization usually means "trust the operator" — production figures, yield math, and compliance all happen in a black box.

## The Solution

Sawit Finance tokenizes **CPO production revenue** as **SAWIT** (a CEP-18 token). Each token is a fractional, yield-bearing claim on real palm oil output — not a synthetic, not a price tracker. Production is verified by an AI oracle, SAWIT is minted against verified tonnage, and revenue flows back to holders as on-chain CSPR yield.

The difference from a typical RWA: **every operator action is verifiable on-chain.** An AI oracle's accuracy is scored on-chain, mint amounts are read cross-contract (the operator can't fabricate them), and yield claims are KYC-gated and leave permanent receipts. A trusted operator that can't lie undetected.

**Four Casper contracts** (Odra Framework, upgradable packages on Testnet):

| Contract | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **ProductionVault** | Stores AI-verified CPO data (tons, price, mills), the KYC registry, and the rolling oracle reputation score |
| **SawitToken** | CEP-18 token — SAWIT — the yield-bearing claim on CPO revenue |
| **TokenMinter** | Reads the verified epoch from ProductionVault (CPI) → mints via SawitToken.mint() (CPI) |
| **YieldDistributor** | Holds CSPR revenue per epoch; KYC-gated claims (checks ProductionVault via CPI) |

---

## Live on Casper Testnet — the full loop, executed on-chain

The complete cycle has run end-to-end on `casper-test`: **record production → mint SAWIT → fund yield → KYC-gated claim.** Every step is a real transaction:

| Step | What happened | Tx |
|------|---------------|----|
| 1. Record | Oracle records epoch: 45,200 t CPO @ $825, oracle reputation 92/100 | [`4d83e1a4…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/4d83e1a4b9c12ee2f386e0e14fd325a14ae81abb9446508650a20471b54a7bdb) |
| 2. Mint | TokenMinter (CPI→Vault, CPI→Token) mints **2,260,000 SAWIT** | [`b257a688…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/b257a68867b5253b1d5f05c6e362759091f91ec223cd650b6f555335351afb93) |
| 3. Fund | Distribution epoch funded with **100 CSPR** (90-day claim window) | [`6fb18931…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/6fb1893145d969bad32e0f6ba26810a81f532be5b5b288af3977a142e489772f) |
| 4. Claim | KYC-verified holder claims (CPI→Vault KYC check) → **CSPR to holder** | [`23e6e9d7…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/23e6e9d7d665a3a94e58170ee2c70434cf6dc71f8c18a2998f97f8497f80f8f6) |

This exercises every core entrypoint, **3 real cross-contract CPIs**, and a **payable** CSPR transfer — the same flow the AI agents drive autonomously.

> Yield settles in **CSPR** in v1. Because CPO revenue is USD-denominated, v2 swaps yield to a USD stablecoin ([csprUSD](https://www.casper.network/news/sarson-funds-csprusd-stablecoin-live-on-casper-network-testnet)) — a drop-in CEP-18 change. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## The Agentic Layer

Three AI agents run the protocol autonomously — this is the heart of the Buildathon entry.

| Agent | Role | AI |
|-------|------|----|
| **Oracle Agent** | Anchors on the live FRED/IMF palm oil price, cross-validates GAPKI/KPBN/MPOB with Gemini, posts verified data on-chain | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **Yield Router** | Monitors CPO price, auto-triggers CSPR yield distribution when a threshold is met | Rule-based |
| **Market Analyst** | Reads all 4 contracts, runs Gemini strategy analysis, **autonomously adjusts GORR on-chain** | Gemini 2.5 Flash |

**Every agent writes on-chain — for real (no simulated hashes).** Each agent signs and broadcasts its decision as a live Casper transaction: the Oracle records verified production ([`2e6e00b1…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/2e6e00b168066072d960184fdee4300c46a946dbb3b6b6b141c8fcb8166e8ac6)), the Yield Router funds a distribution epoch ([`3cb6b496…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/3cb6b496392c88b80e2ebe64820d2858b78e948072f963ac52b9f122438856b8)), and the Market Analyst tunes GORR ([`1b703ee1…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/1b703ee1d289ebdcee96496b2ff0d0ecb8c9aad708c6ad29f31dd428467cc0d0)). Two agents are **LLM-driven** (Oracle, Market Analyst — Gemini 2.5 Flash); the Yield Router is a **rule-based trigger**. All three act through the same signed-livenet path.

**Closed-loop autonomy — a real on-chain decision.** The Market Analyst is the only agent that closes the loop: `READ chain → REASON with Gemini → WRITE back to chain`. With `AUTONOMY_MODE=on` it signs and **broadcasts a real `TokenMinter.update_config()` transaction** to tune GORR from its own analysis. This isn't scaffolded — here's an actual agent-driven GORR change on Testnet: [`1b703ee1…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/transaction/1b703ee1d289ebdcee96496b2ff0d0ecb8c9aad708c6ad29f31dd428467cc0d0) (the agent moved GORR 510→500 bps). **Safety rails** cap any single change to ±100 bps and lock GORR to a [1%, 10%] band — a hallucinated recommendation can never harm holders.

**Gemini reasoning gate.** Before data hits the chain, the Oracle Agent passes all 3 source readings to Gemini, which flags seasonal anomalies / suspicious spikes and can veto a submission (`"recommendation": "REJECT"` blocks the epoch regardless of the statistical score).

**x402 micropayments — live on-chain settlement.** Agents pay per-request for gated CPO data using a real **x402 handshake** (ed25519, amount/recipient/resource/nonce binding, replay-protected). Settlement is **live**: `agents/x402_settle.py` runs the handshake and then **broadcasts a real native CSPR transfer on Casper Testnet** for the payment, verifying it executed before serving the data. Example settlement: [`8b25fb9e…`](https://testnet.cspr.live/deploy/8b25fb9e548b2f3cf639f5ca65e5c54581223f43bb3a647730b0d6fffb074856).

**Casper MCP Server.** `agents/mcp_server.py` exposes the protocol's live on-chain state to any MCP-compatible LLM (Claude, etc.) as standardized tools — the Casper AI Toolkit pattern. An LLM can query SAWIT supply, oracle reputation, a holder's position, and the live palm oil price through tool calls instead of bespoke API glue.

| MCP tool | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `get_protocol_state` | SAWIT supply, CPO value/tons/price, GORR, oracle reputation, epochs, claim window |
| `get_oracle_reputation` | rolling on-chain accuracy score (0–100) + interpretation |
| `get_account_position` | a holder's SAWIT balance + claimable CSPR (by public key) |
| `get_palm_oil_price` | live FRED `PPOILUSDM` (IMF) palm-oil price |
| `get_contracts` / `get_economic_loop` | deployed hashes + executed-loop tx (cspr.live links) |
| `refresh_protocol_state` | force a fresh live read of all four contracts |

## On-Chain Oracle Reputation

A trust-minimized oracle — directly requested by the Buildathon judging criteria. Every time the Oracle Agent submits data, `ProductionVault` records the validation score and maintains a public rolling average:

```
reputation_score = sum(validation_scores) / total_submissions
```

Readable on-chain via `get_oracle_reputation()` — any holder, auditor, or contract can verify oracle reliability without trusting the operator. An `OracleReputationUpdated` event gives a full auditable history. A score < 60/100 reverts the epoch; ≥ 90 means all three benchmarks agree.

---

## Why It's Trustworthy (a permissioned RWA, done honestly)

Tokenizing regulated palm-oil revenue legally requires a licensed operator + KYC/AML — so Sawit Finance embraces a trusted operator **and makes its every action auditable on-chain**, rather than pretending the operator doesn't exist.

- **Oracle can't fabricate** — mint amounts are read from ProductionVault via CPI; every submission updates the public reputation score.
- **Yield is KYC-gated** — only KYC-verified holders can claim (enforced cross-contract); claims leave permanent receipts.
- **Multi-source validation** — data rejected if the 3 sources diverge > 10% or the score drops below 60/100.
- **AI safety rails** — autonomous GORR changes capped to ±100 bps/cycle, locked to [1%, 10%].

The one documented trade-off: per-holder shares are computed off-chain (CEP-18 has no on-chain holder enumeration), then posted — amounts and claims stay fully visible on-chain. **Roadmap:** Merkle-proof claims remove even this, multi-sig operator, DAO-governed GORR bounds.

---

## Tokenomics

```
sawit_minted = tons_cpo × token_rate × (gorr_bps / 10,000)
```

- **token_rate** = 1,000 SAWIT per ton CPO (configurable)
- **GORR** = Gross Overriding Royalty Rate — share of CPO revenue routed to holders

**Example (June 2026 epoch):** 45,000 t × $825 = **$37.1M** gross revenue; at 500 bps GORR → **$1.86M** to holders, **2,250,000 SAWIT** minted (~12% APY target). For a $1M raise against $1.5M/month revenue, ~67 bps GORR delivers 12% APY.

## Roadmap

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| 🔜 | **Stablecoin yield** — settle in [csprUSD](https://www.casper.network/news/sarson-funds-csprusd-stablecoin-live-on-casper-network-testnet) (drop-in CEP-18) to remove the USD/CSPR FX mismatch |
| 🔜 | **Merkle-based claims** — gas-efficient, operator-trustless distribution at holder scale |
| 🔜 | **Mainnet + real mill data partnerships** (GAPKI/KPBN production feeds) |

> CSPR yield ships in v1 because the native-CSPR loop is fully working today with zero external dependencies; the stablecoin swap is a clean, well-scoped v2.
